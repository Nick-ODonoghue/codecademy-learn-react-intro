## Sticking Points & What I learned

Functional Component Syntax

- This was frustrating at first, knowing when to put everything inside a fragment (or not). Knowing when to add curly braces or just parenthesis. I'm getting the hang of it now, but in the beggining I felt like it was sending me on wild goose chases lol

Ternary Operators and &&

- Learning to use both the ternary operators or the && operator in the ways shown was really cool I thought. I feel like being shown how it is done a lot in react really made me think of logic in a different way to how I've been thinking about it before.
